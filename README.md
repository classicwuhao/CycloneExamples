## Online Editor
Reviewers are always welcome to use [our online editor](https://fyp.cs.nuim.ie/projects/FYP24WH008) which does not require install anything. However, the server has a 2 second time-out setting just in case users are running examples that take too much time to complete. For large problem sets, please consider using VSCode extension or binary files

## VSCode Extension
